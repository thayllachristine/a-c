# Stages

You'll need to reproduce the behavior on this video: https://cdn.amaro.com/frontend-test/stages.mp4

- Parse the data.json and construct a single array with all the required data.
- Explain the approach you will implement using comments.
- Implement the code

You're free to ask questions and search the web for documentation but not pre-made solutions.

> You have 1 hour!

## Rules

- Use the data.json file to construct your steps
- The render state should be in the Parent
- The child should handle the Parent update with a callback
- Hooks only

I suggest using styled-minimal for styling since it already has the required capabilities but feel free to use another.

## Bonus

Render a message in the parent after the cycle ends with the exact duration...
